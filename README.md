# BeerKing

This is a JavaScript code for a simple 2D game. The game involves a player that collects beer mugs and gains a score. The code handles the animation of the player, the collection of the beer mugs, and collision detection with the canvas. It also includes event listeners for user input, such as moving the player left and right, and reloading the game.
